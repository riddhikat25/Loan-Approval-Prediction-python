# Loan-Approval-Prediction-python

### **1. Data Preprocessing:**
   - The project starts by loading a dataset from a CSV file (`loan.csv`), which likely contains information on loans (e.g., loan amount, borrower information, loan status).
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. This step could involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data, though the specific preprocessing steps were not fully shown in the initial preview.

### **2. Machine Learning Models:**
   - **Logistic Regression:** This model is applied to predict binary outcomes, possibly whether a loan will be approved or defaulted based on the input features.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Another classification algorithm used in the project, which separates data points into different classes using hyperplanes.

### **3. Data Visualization:**
   - The project uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization, which likely helps illustrate relationships between variables, such as correlations between borrower characteristics and loan status.

### **4. Train-Test Split:**
   - The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`. This allows the model to be trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on another to assess performance.

### **5. Model Evaluation:**
   - The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, which provide insights into how well the model predicts outcomes, distinguishing between true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

This project focuses on predicting loan outcomes using different machine learning techniques and evaluating model performance.
